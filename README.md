# 🚨 DoS/DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

**Final Year B.Tech Project**  
**Department of CSE (Cyber Security)**  
**Haldia Institute of Technology, 2025**

A collaborative research project aimed at detecting Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning and deep learning models on real-world network traffic datasets. The system integrates traditional ML models, transformer-based deep learning, and real-time packet analysis using tools like Wireshark and the Elastic Stack.

## 🧠 Project Overview

DoS/DDoS attacks are among the most disruptive cyber threats, targeting network availability through resource exhaustion. Traditional firewalls and signature-based IDS often fail to detect novel attack patterns. This project proposes a hybrid, intelligent detection system using supervised ML classifiers, real-time traffic monitoring, and deep contextual analysis to identify malicious patterns with high accuracy.

> 📊 **Best Performing Model: BERT-inspired Transformer — 97.1% Accuracy**

## 🔍 Objectives

- Detect DoS/DDoS patterns using packet-level features and protocol behaviors.
- Train multiple ML models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Apply advanced deep learning (BERT/Transformer, LSTM) for contextual analysis.
- Use Wireshark for real-time traffic capture.
- Visualize live traffic insights using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Ensure detection scalability and interpretability via SHAP and attention scores.
